# Agent skills — single source, consumed by every tool

This directory is the **single source** for the repository's vendor-neutral
[Agent Skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills): each
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` carries YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus Markdown
instructions. Every tool matches on the `description` to decide when a skill applies. All
tool-specific files only point here — never copy a skill's body.

| Skill | When it fires | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| [`bpmn-conformance`](bpmn-conformance/SKILL.md) | editing `**/*.bpmn` or `packages/*/src/moddle/*.json` | `npm run check:conformance` |
| [`moddle-extension-review`](moddle-extension-review/SKILL.md) | changing a moddle type / property / namespace / prefix in `packages/*/src/moddle/*.json` | `npm run check:conformance` |
| [`bpmn-naming-publishing`](bpmn-naming-publishing/SKILL.md) | editing `packages/*/package.json` or releasing | `npm run check:packages` |

## Analysis skills (vendored from the MiHUB Patient-Portal toolset, adapted)

General code-health skills, **invoked on demand** (not auto-gated on a file pattern) and
**detection / analysis only** — they report for human review and never edit or delete.

| Skill | Use it to |
|---|---|
| [`dead-code-detector`](dead-code-detector/SKILL.md) | find unused exports, dead modules, orphaned moddle types / properties-panel entries |
| [`feature-inventarist`](feature-inventarist/SKILL.md) | build a Feature Inventory Matrix across the packages (preliminary maturity) |
| [`docs-auditor`](docs-auditor/SKILL.md) | role-aware docs ↔ code consistency / coverage / link audit + small consolidation plan |
| [`security-reviewer`](security-reviewer/SKILL.md) | review secrets, PII in fixtures, supply chain, unsafe XML/DOM sinks |
| [`arc42-generator`](arc42-generator/SKILL.md) | derive / refresh the arc42 skeleton (the `arc42/` chapters) from code |
| [`test-generator`](test-generator/SKILL.md) | write Vitest characterization tests before a refactor |

Companion slash-commands live in [`.claude/commands/`](../.claude/commands/): `classify-feature`,
`inventory-update`, `draft-arc42`, `adr-draft`, `upgrade-dep` (Claude Code-specific; the analysis
skills above are the cross-tool form, auto-discovered by Codex/Copilot via the same symlinks).

## How each tool consumes these skills

- **Claude Code** — auto-discovers via the `.claude/skills` symlink (→ `../skills`); loads a
  skill when the task matches its `description`. No extra config.
- **OpenAI Codex** — auto-discovers via the `.agents/skills` symlink (→ `../skills`): Codex scans
  `.agents/skills` from the working directory up to the repo root and follows symlink targets.
  Implicit invocation (matches `description`) or explicit (`/skills`, or `$<name>` in a prompt).
  The trigger/path mapping is also spelled out in the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) because
  Codex has no per-glob `applyTo` frontmatter. (Codex custom prompts are personal-only —
  `~/.codex/prompts` — and deprecated; these committed skills are the shared equivalent.)
- **GitHub Copilot** — auto-discovers via the `.agents/skills` (or `.claude/skills`) symlink;
  Copilot scans `.github/skills` / `.claude/skills` / `.agents/skills`, **not** a top-level
  `skills/`. Copilot also reads [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../.github/copilot-instructions.md)
  (repo-wide), [`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`](../.github/instructions/) (path-scoped via
  `applyTo` globs), and the manual `/`-invoked [`.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`](../.github/prompts/)
  wrappers — all of which point back to these SKILL.md files.
- **Cursor / other AGENTS.md readers** — read the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), whose
  "Agent skills" section lists the same triggers and gate commands.

## Editing rule

Change a skill in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` only. The pointer files in `.github/`, `AGENTS.md`,
and the `.claude/skills` / `.agents/skills` symlinks reference it; they must never copy its body.
